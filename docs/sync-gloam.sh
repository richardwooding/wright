# sync-gloam.sh — vendor gloam.css and gloam.js from the canonical repo.
#
# gloam lives at github.com/richardwooding/gloam; consumers keep a *copy* of
# gloam.css/gloam.js next to their page. Run this to refresh that copy so the
# consumer doesn't drift from the design system.
#
# Usage:
#   sync-gloam.sh [target-dir] [ref]
#     target-dir  where gloam.css/gloam.js live (default: the script's own dir)
#     ref         branch or commit to sync from (default: main)
#
# Both files are fetched from the same resolved commit, and the commit is
# recorded in <target-dir>/.gloam-version for drift detection.
